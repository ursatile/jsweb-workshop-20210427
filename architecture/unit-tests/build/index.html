    <my-counter initial-value="25"></my-counter>
    <p>Press the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to increment and decrement the counter.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>This version of the counter application has been split into separate JS modules, but those modules have not
        been implemented. The missing methods are marked with //TODO comments - you'll need to figure out what
        should go in these methods and add the missing code.

    <h4>A note about ES modules</h4>
    <p>This project uses <code>&lt;script type="module"&gt;</code> and ES modules, so it <strong>will not work from a
            file:// URL</strong></p>
    <p>You'll need to run a local web server that serves <code>.js</code> files with the
        <code>application/javascript</code> MIME type -
        if you don't have one set up, check out <a href="https://github.com/rif/spark">rif/spark</a>, a tiny web server
        written in Go
        that will turn any folder on your machine into a website.
